# Plant-moisture-alert
An arduino based system that takes input from a moisture sensor and lights a LED based on the amount of water in the ground

For this you'll need 1 Arduino module, 1 moisture sensor and 3 LED's, a breadboard and jumpercables are recommended.

Connect the LED's to D2, D3 and D4. Make sure the negative sides of all LED's are grounded.
(4 is most dry, 3 is dry, none is ok, 2 is wet)
Connect your moisture sensor to the arduino and use the serial plotter to adjust the values (green, yellow, red) to suit your needs.
The amount of Ohm needed is dependent on the part you use, use common sense. 

Things may not work.
Code is free to use.
